# Depression Risk Analyzer Project

A machine learning-powered web application to identify individuals at risk of depression using non-clinical behavioral and demographic data.

---

## Problem Statement

Depression is a widespread but serious mental health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early identification of individuals at risk can enable timely interventions and reduce the likelihood of severe outcomes. Traditional clinical assessments, however, are not always accessible due to barriers like cost, stigma, or limited access to mental health professionals.

This project proposes an accessible, data-driven solution: a machine learning model that predicts depression risk using survey data. The dataset includes behavioral and lifestyle indicators such as age, gender, job satisfaction, study/work hours, and family history—factors known to correlate with mental health but that don’t require clinical diagnosis.

To ensure privacy and broad usability, we use a **synthetic dataset** generated by a deep learning model trained on real survey data. This allows open research and experimentation while safeguarding sensitive personal information.

## Solution Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a machine learning model that classifies depression risk (`Yes` or `No`) based on survey inputs. By comparing synthetic vs. real data performance, we also explore how synthetic data can effectively approximate real-world conditions.

### Key Objectives:
- **Model Development**: Train and evaluate ML models for depression risk classification.
- **Data Insights**: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand correlations and patterns.
- **Deployment**: Containerize and deploy the app as a REST API using Docker.
- **Synthetic Data Evaluation**: Analyze model behavior on synthetic data vs. original data.

This project is intended for researchers, mental health practitioners, data scientists exploring healthcare analytics, and policy advocates interested in data-driven public health tools.

## Web Service Usage
You can interact with the model via HTTP POST request.

## Sample Request in Python:

- import requests

url = 'http://localhost:9696/predict'
person = {
  "age": 60.0,
  "academic-pressure": -1,
  "work-pressure": 5,
  "cgpa": -1,
  "study-satisfaction": -1,
  "job-satisfaction": 1,
  "work-study-hours": 15.0,
  "financial-stress": 5.0,
  "gender": "male",
  "city": "pune",
  "working-professional-or-student": "working professional",
  "profession": "teacher",
  "sleep-duration": "less than 5 hours",
  "dietary-habits": "unhealthy",
  "degree": "b.tech",
  "have-you-ever-had-suicidal-thoughts-?": "yes",
  "family-history-of-mental-illness": "yes"
}
response = requests.post(url, json=person)
print(response.json())


```
Or via CURL:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "age": 60.0,
  ...
  "family-history-of-mental-illness": "yes"
}' http://localhost:9696/predict

```
